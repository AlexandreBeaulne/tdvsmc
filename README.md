# pytorch-a3c

This is a PyTorch implementation of Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) from ["Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v1.pdf).

This implementation is inspired by [Universe Starter Agent](https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent).
In contrast to the starter agent, it uses an optimizer with shared statistics as in the original paper.
